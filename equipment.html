Our Codex Equipment:

Here at Codex we are fortunate enough to have access to an array of high end 
Android devices. These include Samsung tablets and phones as well as Google Phones.
The majority of our work is done on our Dell laptops running Linux. Linux is a very 
powerful open source operating system that provides the flexibility and agility characteristic 
of this industry.
<br> 
The vast range of tablets and phones allow us the opportunity to rapidly test our applications
and webpages. We recently had the android cabinet installed in our offices. This is a cabinet
filled with android devices, all at our disposal for use on any projects we work on! Yikes!!!

If you look at the image on the left, you can see the types of equipment we use at Codex
Academy. 

We are thoroughly looking forward to using the various devices during our journey to becoming
coding masters!! <br><br>
Follow our journey!
